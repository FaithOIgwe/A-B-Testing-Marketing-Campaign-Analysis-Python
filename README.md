# Marketing Campaigns A/B Testing: Leveraging Python for Effective Campaign Evaluation

## Case Study:
A fashion retail company is gearing up to introduce a new product into their apparel catalog. However, the management is faced with the dilemma of selecting the most effective marketing campaign among three options to promote their new offering. To address this challenge, they opt for a randomized approach, distributing the new product to randomly selected outlets and implementing different marketing campaigns across these outlets. The impact of each marketing campaign on product sales is then assessed by analyzing weekly sales data over the course of four effective weeks.

#### Dataset Description:
Our dataset comprises 548 observations, including the following variables:

OutletID: A unique identifier for each store location, totaling 137 stores.
AgeofOutlets: The age of each store in years, ranging from 1 to 28, with a mean age of 8.5 years.
Campaigns: Three different promotions tested (labeled as 1, 2, and 3).
Sales in Thousands: The sales amount for a specific LocationID, Promotion, and week, with an average sales value of $53.5 thousand.
Market size: Categorized into small, medium, and large markets.
